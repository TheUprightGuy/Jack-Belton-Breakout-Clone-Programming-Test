Some stuff I did that isn't immediatly visible when just playing the game,
Created a editor tool for spawning the bricks in set densitys with specific spacing, and used a gradient to color the rows
Created backend for multiplayer in the future, with score array
Started on mirror implementation but was not stable enough with my current experience.
